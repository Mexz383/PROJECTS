# PROJECT TOPIC: INCIDENT MONITORING AND LOG ANALYSIS

## OBJECTIVE
The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. 
The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### SKILLS LEARNED
- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### TOOLS USED
- VirtualBox — https://www.virtualbox.org
- SIEM system (such as Splunk — https://www.splunk.com) for log ingestion and analysis.
- Windows 10 ISO — https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.

## PREPARING THE ENVIRONMENT:
Step 1: Set up a Hypervisor or Cloud Provider: 
Choose a hypervisor like VMware, VirtualBox, or a cloud provider like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform to host your virtual machine

Step 2: Create a Virtual Machine (VM):
Install a suitable operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or Windows Server) and configure it to run Splunk for the SIEM.
For this lab I am using VirtualBox and creating a Windows 10 virtual machine.
Once the Windows 10 virtual machine setup is complete we can start installing the tools for this lab


Installing and Configuring Splunk:
Step 3: Download and Install Splunk: Download the Splunk Enterprise installer from the official website and follow the installation instructions.

Splunk
Products > splunk enterprise > free trial (need to create an account)

Step 4: Configure Splunk:
Set up basic configurations such as admin password, data inputs, and indexes.
Configure data inputs to accept Windows event logs and any other relevant data sources.
